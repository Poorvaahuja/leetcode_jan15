LEETCODE PROBLEMS
## Q1 Find players with zero of one losses
You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
Return a list answer of size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
Note:
You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.

## Q2 Image smoother
An image smoother is a filter of the size 3 x 3 that can be applied to each cell of an image by rounding down the average of the cell and the eight surrounding cells (i.e., the average of the nine cells in the blue smoother). If one or more of the surrounding cells of a cell is not present, we do not consider it in the average (i.e., the average of the four cells in the red smoother).
