## Q1 Find players with zero of one losses
You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
Return a list answer of size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
Note:
You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
